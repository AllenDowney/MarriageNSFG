# Marriage and Education: CPS Data

Outline:

* Motivated by "Gender Gaps in College: What Do They Mean for Marriage?", which shows that marriage rates have sharply declined among women without a college degree.

* Which raises several related questions: 

    - What do these patterns look like at different ages (not just 40-49)? 
    
    - What do they look like for men? 
    
    - And how are they different if we look at "ever married" rather than "married when interviewed"

* Primary findings:

    - Early marriage (at or before age 24): In previous generations, college-educated men and women were less likely to get married early. Now early marriage is less likely across the board, and there is no difference between people with and without a college degree.

    - Marriage by age 33: Among both men and women, marriage at or before age 33 has crossed over -- that is, in previous generations, the college-educated were less likely to marry on a nominal schedule. Now they are more likely (but not by a lot).

    - The pattern is similar in marriage by age 45. People with college degrees are more likely to marry, but the difference is only about 5 percentage points.

Comparison with previous results: the education gap is bigger if we look at marital status, rather than "ever married". Likely explanations: people without degrees were more likely to marry early (shown), and more likely to divorce (not shown, but could be).
